    "I split the dataset into Train 80% and Valid 20%.  Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set before augmentation. This is a histogram showing how the train data is.  The data set has more negative angle because original data set has counter-clockwise direction.\n",

    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model is based on nVidea model with added Dropout. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains dropout layers with 0.5 every after Full Connecting Network and with 0.1 every after CNN in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 21). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (create_model()).\n",
    "And I used Checkpoint with saving best only. This is a learning curb.\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (create_model in model.py line 141).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ... \n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "First I tested LeNet, nVidia, AlexNet, VGG, and GoogLeNet, first (cloneleNet.py, cloneNVidia.py, cloneAlexNet.py, cloneVGG.py, and cloneGoogleNet.py).  LeNet and nVidia were OK, but AlexNet and VGG have a big network and I could not train them on my PC.  I could train them on Linux, but H5 files look inconmatible to my pc even if I have the same version of Keras and Tensorflow.  Also I could not train GoogleNet because of issue of TensorFlow on MKL-DNN.  \n",
    "At this first stage, nVidia was the best among those 5 networks, because of its size and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I decided to use nVidia model with some tuning.  I added regularization, but it made worse, but Dropout made a little better.  I added Dropout with 0.1 after CNN, and Dropout with 0.5 after Fully Connected Network.\n",
    "But car didn't turn on sharp turn with any tuning.  So I decided to add more images.\n",
    "\n",
    "I added flipped image, and images from left and right Camera with 0.2 adjustment.  And I changed to use generator because of many data.  Then it finally could run on whole course.  But it didn't turn at a sharp turn with speed 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I added images of driving with opposite direction.  But it didn't improve a lot.  I wanted to add data of track 2.  But it was not to easy to drive on track 2.  And I also wanted to add images when I drive at hight speed.  But it is also not eash to make it.  So I stopped here.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
